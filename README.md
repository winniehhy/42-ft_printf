## About the project </h2>
This project is pretty straight forward. Basically recode printf function and it's library. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments. </p>

Basically is just replicating the printf function ( %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %p, %%);
```
 %c Prints a single character. </p>
 %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention). </p>
 %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format. </p>
 %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number. </p>
 %i Prints an integer in base 10. </p>
 %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number. </p>
 %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format. </p>
 %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format. </p>
 %% Prints a percent sign. </p>
```
